Imagine we get individual student's data with their activity of attendance of every school in India, Please suggest some solution (In words, Not code).
We have this type of data format.
{"state":"Gujarat","schoolId":"10f658d42","standard":"11","studentId":"37e6893a7978c","Attended":"1","timestamp":"11-02-11 16:47:35,985 +0000"}
We need to understand firstly that what is dropout rate.
A  dropout  is  a  pupil  who  leaves  school  before  the  completion  of  a  school  stage  or  leaving  at  some  intermediate  or  non-terminal  point  of  a  given  level  of  education  (school stage). 
This term ‘dropout’ has been used in two senses. It may mean either: (i) one who has discontinued  education  before  completing  the  last  level  of  education  for  which  
18 he/she  was  enrolled  or  (ii)  one  who  has  discontinued  education  before  attaining  a  specific   level.   According   to   the   first   definition,   for   example,   if   a   person   has   completed the upper primary level 
but does not enroll for higher education, he/she is not considered a dropout. It is considered as a case of discontinuation. However, if the  person  enrolls  for  the  secondary  level  but  does  not  complete  it,  then  he/she  is  considered  a  dropout. 
According  to  the  second  definition,  in  either  case  the  person  would  be  considered  a  dropout,  when,  secondary  level  is  considered  as  specific  level.
If a student is absent regularly for some specific time then we can consider it as dropout.By the data we can calculate dropout rate 
standardwise.And in this data we have studentid also so we can get his/her enrollment details for further classes. Then we can filter the data according to state.After this we can calculate avrage,minimum,highest dropout rate of states and can make analysis on them.
